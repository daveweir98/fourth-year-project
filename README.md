Car Damage analysis is a project which aims to streamline the returns process in car rental companies at the moment. 

Images of cars are captured by an enclosure surrounding the car, these images are then analysed using machine learning algorithms in order for a prediction to be made as to whether the car is damaged or not. Damaged cars are displayed to employees through a web application.

This project aids in increasing the productivity of employees in car rentals companies by reducing the amount of time taken to analyse a car for damages.
